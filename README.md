### Arthropod Expansion
A small mod helmed by Nekomaster of Infernal Expansion and Neko's Enchanted Books... 
Arthropod Expansion seeks to add a dozen brand new arthropod-based mobs into the game for you to get some extra use out of one of Minecraft's most useless enchantments! (Beyond that though, it's also to just add more fun mobs with an underutilised and common theme to the game :>)
